# ScaleManager
Arduino library for managing musical scales and frequencies

Developed in order to speed up implementation of scales/keys on Midi instruments. See examples for usage.

Currently extremely memory hungry - sorry! I would appreciate input on structuring the scaleManager / scale classes.
